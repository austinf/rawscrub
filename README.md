rawscrub
========

Clean up your RAW photo directories after a big culling run through your JPEG's

Usage:
> ./rawscrub.py -r /path/to/RAW/photos -j /path/to/JPEG/photos

Help:
> ./rawscrub.py -h

This assume a directory structure where a session's files are split up (RAW,JPEG), 
but they have the same directory names, so the script can compare their contents
